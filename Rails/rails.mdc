- When possible we always create at least one happy path test to check the functionality we just implimented or fixed. So if I e.g. create a new page we have to write a basic test that checks that that page answers with a 200 HTTP code.

- Always Use bin/rails
   - Use `bin/rails` instead of just `rails`
   - Ensures consistent environment
   - Uses project-specific binstubs

Modify or create the code as requested. After completing the changes, execute the following commands in the terminal:

1. Run tests to ensure everything still works:
   ```sh
   bundle exec rspec
   ```
2. Automatically fix and check Ruby style issues:
   ```sh
    bundle exec rubocop --format github --autocorrect-all
    ```
3. If any tests fail:
- Analyze the errors and attempt to fix them. It doesn't matter if it is old or new code.
- Modify the necessary code to resolve the failures.
- Re-run "bundle exec rspec" to confirm the fix.
